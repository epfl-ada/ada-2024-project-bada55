    "### The Importance of the Rating System in Interpreting Beer Ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "The rating system is essential for understanding the scores given to a beer. Notably, the same overall rating on BeerAdvocate and RateBeer does not reflect identical scores across different topics. In theory, if a user provides the same scores and descriptions for a beer on both platforms, the overall score would still differ between the two sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "The topics considered in these ratings are as follows: **\"appearance,\" \"aroma,\" \"palate,\" \"taste,\" and \"overall.\"** Concretely, the overall score is a weighted average of these topics' ratings. Our objective is to determine these weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "This relationship can be analyzed through a **linear regression (without intercept)**. Formally, we aim to find the coefficients $(\\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\beta_3, \\beta_4, \\beta_5)$ such that:\n",
    "\n",

    "### Analysis of BeerAdvocate and RateBeer Notation System\n",
    "\n",
    "BeerAdvocate and RateBeer assign similar weights to **appearance**, **aroma**, and **palate** (approximately 6%-9%, 20%-24%, and 10%, respectively). These criteria contribute comparably to the overall rating on both platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, significant differences emerge for **taste** and **overall**:  \n",
    "- BeerAdvocate gives much greater weight to **taste** (40%) compared to RateBeer (20%), indicating that the perception of taste is crucial for high ratings on BeerAdvocate.  \n",
    "- Conversely, RateBeer assigns double the weight to **overall** (42%) than BeerAdvocate (20%), emphasizing a more general, holistic evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implications:  \n",
    "- **BeerAdvocate** prioritizes sensory aspects like **taste**, making it key for achieving high ratings.  \n",
    "- **RateBeer** takes a broader approach, with the **overall** impression being the most critical factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "This distinction helps explain why the same beer may receive different scores across the two platforms, even with similar topic-level ratings.\n"

    "\n",
    "The results of the linear regression confirm the validity of the topic weightings found for both BeerAdvocate and RateBeer. With an \\(R^2\\) of **1.00** for both platforms, it is evident that the five topics (**appearance**, **aroma**, **palate**, **taste**, and **overall**) fully determine the final rating. The coefficients reflect the relative importance of each topic, highlighting the key differences between the platforms: BeerAdvocate prioritizes **taste**, while RateBeer emphasizes the **overall** impression. These findings provide a clear understanding of how each platform evaluates beer ratings and the factors that influence their scoring systems.\n"
